The application of the product was somewhat easy on my long hair and the smell was not too overbearing. \n\nAfter washing and drying my hair I was surprised at how light the color turned out. My highlights are more blended but you can still see the color variations in my hair. I would say this color is closer to a medium brown then a dark brown. It has a little bit of warmth to it. It didn't exactly turn out like the photo on the box but I'm still happy with the color. My hair also feels soft to the touch and looks healthier than before I colored it.

If you look at the picture I included the cover is not very wrinkle free.\r\n\r\nI thought the color was going to be more of a tan shade/tone. It depends on the lighting I see a dark tan/green tone. It's hard to say exactly what color the cover is. The cover is machine washable in warm water and tumble dry.\r\n\r\nThe duvet cover is wide and long enough to cover a comforter. There are six buttons at one end of the covet to close it up. The button holes were too short/small and I had a very hard time buttoning the buttons. I think it would be a lot nicer if there was a zipper in place of buttons. A zipper would also have a nicer appearance having the bottom closed up verses opened spaces in between the six buttons.\r\n\r\nI would say the length isn't what I would consider extra long. I adjusted the comforter to hang over the side away from the wall and at the end of the bed to cover the box spring. I don't have a bed skirt.

The chiffon fabric is not only breathable but also incredibly soft, providing a luxurious feel against the skin. The V-neck design adds a touch of versatility and sophistication, making it suitable for various occasions, from business meetings to casual outings. I like the lightweight and flowy nature of the fabric, coupled with the silky smooth texture for sure.\n\nThe 95% polyester and 5% spandex blend ensures a long lifetime. My busy lifestyle really likes the wrinkle-free material. There are thoughtful design features such as the option to roll up and secure the sleeves for a 3/4 look, allowing for adaptability in different seasons. The pleated front and relaxed silhouette give it a classy and professional appearance. The length is just right – long enough to cover my backside, providing a flattering fit.\n\nI can recommend this to anyone in search of a business casual and fashionable top that effortlessly combines style, comfort, and versatility.

SHAG RUG CARE INSTRUCTION - Spray extraction, along with use of a wool-approved product, can be used to clean shag rugs. Shedding is normal for shag products and decreases over time. Do not pull yarn out, as this may result in damage to the rug. Canister vacuums without a beater bar are most effective in cleaning shag rugs. Vacuums with beater bars and/or brushes, or those set too low, may abrade the face of the rug.

MADE IN Turkey - Indulge in luxury with our Turkish area rug. Crafted with high-quality materials, this rug is not only durable but also adds a touch of sophistication to any room. Bring the rich history and elegance of Turkey into your home with this exclusive piece.   HOW TO VACUUM YOUR RUG - To vacuum your rug, use a canister vacuum without a beater bar a broom, or a manual sweeper. Upright vacuums with high suction power can pull threads from the rug's back and cause ""sprouts."" Use a handheld attachment if possible, or turn off the beater bar as it can pull fibers from the face of the rug and cause the rug to fuzz. If you can't turn it off, set it to the highest position possible. Finally, place the vacuum on the rug carefully.

I never get tired of playing with it and I feel it gives me a pulled-together look and a look that says I care about my appearance. In fact, I was able to be a receptionist for a billion-dollar company even in my late fifties. The makeup helped me look \""polished.\""\r\n\r\nI think a mistake women make is to be scared to use bright colors if they are older, if their skin isn't \""perfect,\"" and if they feel their features aren't \""perfect.\"" Hogwash! Brights look GOOD on ANYONE, it turns out! Not only do the COLORS look good, the CONFIDENCE shown is appealing, too! I no longer ask myself, \""Oh, what will people think?\"" when choosing makeup and clothes. I ask myself, \""Do YOU like this?\"" instead! Life's too short, people!\r\n\r\nWell, I'm talking a big talk, but I did apply the color lightly, just a dot on each side of the bow of the lip, then spread it out with my pinkie to corners for the top (put a dot, pull to side, put the other dot, pull to side), and a bigger dot on the bottom lip and pulled to each side with the pinkie. It gave a wonderful pop of color without emphasizing the lines around my lips. If you are young or don't have the lines yet, use the precise foam brush to fill in the lip with color, instead of spreading a small amount out with your pinkie. On my daughter-in-law, the solid, intense color looks fantastic. \r\n\r\nWhen applied lightly, this color is a vibrant pink with purple tone. When applied solidly, it looks more purple, but not a blue-based purple. It's a red-based, meaning it is more in the pink family.\r\n\r\nThe name is truthful: Color-STAY. Yes, it stays and stays. I don't even retouch during the day.\r\n\r\nHave you seen Lipsense's Violet Reign? This reminds me of it, color-wise. Lipsense is all the rage, but I don't like it. I like, frankly, the Revlon and the Maybelline long-lasting (and 24-hour) lip colors. The Revlon Colorstay I especially like: It doesn't dry my lips, it's reasonable in price, and it lasts longer on me. I can layer it and pull it with my pinkie and it covers beautifully. It isn't patchy when I do this. BIG positive.\r\n\r\nI don't use the gloss end of the lipstick (it comes with the foam tilted coloring-in brush on one end, and a pointed brush-like tip for the gloss on the other) because I like a matte lip with bright colors. For a pinky-brown lip, yes, I'd use the gloss overlay. But for me, I like matte brights."",""title"":""Purple for Mature Lips?

The color is applied to dry, bare lips, you wait while it dries, then the clear gloss goes over. I cannot guarantee that it lasts 16 hours because I haven't timed it, but it does last longer than a lot of lipsticks I've used. It keeps my lips moist, slightly glossy looking, and I've already decided to try some other colors. I have Neverending Purple at the moment; it looks a lot darker than it really is. I really like it, although purple/fuschia/lavender isn't always my first choice. It comes in a wide range of shades, pink, spice, coral, reds, tan, brown--dark and light shades.

It has little to no odor when I smell the wand straight out of the barrel. On my lips, it has no odor or taste. Based on the instructions you apply the lip color, wait until it dries, then apply the clear lip top coat. When it dries it seems to brighten in color and has a matte appearance. The gloss and moisture comes from the top coat. \r\nThe box says that it can last for 16 hours with no touch-ups needed. I applied mine early in the morning, and by 6pm after having eaten meals and snacks, drank water, talked, licked my lips here and there I found that it in fact DID stay on but not as strongly. It was a very bright purple upon first application. By the end of the day it was brought down to a slight dull purple. But, that was with no touch-ups. That is quite impressive. \r\nI suppose if I were at work and were to refresh it after lunch, it would continue being a vibrant lip color. By the way, by mid-day for me, it was still very bright and present so I didn't feel the need to refresh it. \r\nI could have re-applied the top coat to see if that would re-brighten the lip color that remained on my lips at the end of the day, but I was just still impressed that the color was still there and noticeable. Again, not as bright and rich, but still there.

I got these Levi's Women's '94 Baggy Jeans in Plus Size 18 for my mom.  My mom especially needs baggy jeans not only because she likes to wear comfortable clothing, but also because she had both of her knees replaced in the past year.  These jeans are awesome for her!  The thing I love most about them is that she doesn't look like she has a “mom jeans'” rear in them.  They are a muted, almost distressed black color.  These are my mom's first pair of Levi's and she actually looks good in denim for the first time in her 74 years!  She's worn jeans in other brands, but I've never liked denim on her until these from Levi's!\r\n\r\nThough these are '94 Baggy, they don't look sloppy.  My mom is always put-together, and these work for her.  They are straight-cut, so there is no awkward tapering at her ankles or extra length on the back.  The rise is in the middle, so these are perfect to make my mom happy, as they don't press into her stomach at the waist or look too low like lowriders.  These are loose through the thigh and allow her hips room so they are not overly tight in inappropriate areas.  \r\n\r\nMy mom loves the feel of the fabric and the fact that these are slightly stretchy.  She even appreciates that these are made using five percent recycled material.  She's really getting into planet-saving actions, and now even her jeans are doing it with her!

This Collection offers a variety of styles, colors and sizes (including plus sizes). \r\n\r\nThe Levi Strauss, Mid Rise, Light Indigo, ‘94 baggy plus size jeans in size 22W M, are oversized, denim construction, baggy type jeans that are designed to sit high on the waist, with the traditional 5 pocket, zipper fly, design. I really like how Levi Strauss brought the 90's trend back with the Baggy Jeans Collection, it brings back so many memories. \r\n\r\nI find it fascinating how trends from the 90's are coming around again. I've been wearing Levi Strauss Jeans throughout My life and I must say they hold up really well. \r\n\r\nWhen selecting the Levi's ‘94 Baggy Jeans, I would highly recommend trying them on in store because they are made oversized. If You are ordering the jeans online, consider sizing down 2-3 sizes. For reference, I wear size 20-22 in plus size jeans. The ‘94 baggy jeans are nice, high quality jeans that will hold up for a long time. The only down side to the jeans is that they are way oversized, I ordered my usual size and they are like 3 sizes too big for Me."",""title"":""‘94 Baggy Jeans""}]",,61.24,$9.06,,"[""Clothing"",""Womens Plus"",""Plus Size Jeans"",""Plus Size Jeans""]"

And the humidity ? Ack. Although I like the looks and cut of this shirt, it seems to run larger than the 3XL I had ordered. And...the material is very, very heavy; on top of which, I ordered it in black. I'm thinking that it will be best served to wear it open, over a contrasting tee shirt...and in cooler weather. In October that ought to be fine; in May, I'm guessing it would be unbearable. Of importance--also--is whether this shirt will retain its color, shape, and size after several launderings. I will NOT be happy if I end up with 'doll clothes' that have to be ironed. No.No.No. If 'lift-off' is a go, I'll probably buy several other shirts like it. Regards to all.
